xd, a hexdump utility

Copyright 2013 Vadim Vygonets.  Licensed under WTFPL 2.0.


DESCRIPTION
     xd displays input files as hexadecimal, octal or binary numbers.  With
     -r, xd converts a hexadecimal dump into a binary file or patches an
     existing file.  Its output format and user interface were inspired by
     xxd.  It's quite fast.


The world isn't in dire need of yet another hexdump.  But after
looking at the source code for xxd, I was wondering how fast a
Go implementation with a similar custom numerical output routine
would be.  A prototype with a tight inner loop proved to be
significantly faster than xxd, hd, od and hexdump, which
surprised me -- the inner loop was not *that* tight.  Removing
channels and adding buffered I/O made it a bit faster.  So I made
it relatively feature-complete, wrote a man page and threw it on
GitHub, as is the custom these days.

Its feature set is similar to that of xxd (no EBCDIC though).
Decimal output is not supported.  For more details, run "xd -h"
or see the man page.  If you have any request, including "I'm on
Windows and I want the man page rendered", mail me and I'll try
to sort it out.  My e-mail address is on the man page.
